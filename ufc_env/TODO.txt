- TODO:

views.py 
line 133 ---> Change output to not just include who won, but maybe also stats for fighters and prediction accuracy.

result.html
* line 11 ---> Update photo, or remove (additional consideration for layout required)

**** Change font
**** Get fighter name (red/blue_text) into result.html page.
* Potentially create python script that allows user to input stats that references actual fighter. Cosine similiarity
* Figure out how to put fighter's name back into website so that we can reference ML model.
